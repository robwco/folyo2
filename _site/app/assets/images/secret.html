<p>You&#39;re used to experiencing droughts in your business. After all, by definition, freelance work ends. </p>

<p>But this one was bad.</p>

<h2>Each day, the stress mounted</h2>

<p>Every new client meeting became more important. You went in knowing one thing; <strong>“I NEED THIS JOB.”</strong></p>

<p>When you thought you finally might have a new client they slipped through your hands.</p>

<p>They all backed out for different reasons. Some said it was a last minute change in plans, others balked at your rate, but most… most just stop replying altogether. </p>

<p>Worst of all, it seemed like this stretch was going to last forever, like there was no end in sight.</p>

<p>You knew it was something you were doing wrong. </p>

<p>Let’s be real. When you&#39;re in a dry spell, you want that next paycheck bad. You fixate on it to the point that it ruins your chances. </p>

<p>You send a potential client a first email. You urge them to get on board with your idea. You send your portfolio over and describe how it relates to their needs (you do that right?). </p>

<p>You may not be aware of it but this is your biggest missed opportunity to sell your skills.</p>

<h2>Back when you started it was different</h2>

<p>Sure, you wanted to make money, but you also wanted other things. You wanted to create your dream job. You wanted to be your own boss. You wanted freedom to work from anywhere.</p>

<p>Maybe it was the beach or a coffee shop. Somewhere where you could sit down and focus all of your energy on working with great clients. You had <em>somewhere</em> in mind.</p>

<p>But somewhere along the way it became fuzzy. You can&#39;t exactly remember what your dream job looked like, you just know you didn’t picture it like this: stressed, alone, and curled up in the fetal position every month because you haven’t found work.</p>

<h2>You see others succeeding</h2>

<p>It&#39;s been about a year since I started <a href="">Workshop</a>(http://letsworkshop.com), a newsletter that collects the web’s best freelance opportunities and puts them in one place.</p>

<p>Since starting it, I’ve helped hundreds of freelancers make a lot of money (at minimum three or four hundred thousand).</p>

<p>Some have even made more than 100 times what they pay for the service. This is great, but no matter how many people I help, others continue to make nothing. </p>

<p>Even though I send them a daily list of prospects eagerly looking to pay for their skills, they simply don&#39;t land work. This led me to ask why. Why are some freelancers finding work so quickly while others never make a dime? </p>

<p>The truth is most people are really bad at sending emails. </p>

<p>I learned this by asking struggling freelancers to BCC me on emails they were sending, and noticed that almost all of them made the same mistakes.</p>

<h2>There&#39;s something missing</h2>

<p>The worst part was a high percentage never emailed me at all. When asked about it, they said <strong>“I don’t know what to write.”</strong> </p>

<p>So I worked with them on writing better emails. Soon we started seeing results. Leads began responding. They started landing clients.</p>

<p>These 1-on-1 email writing sessions were great, but I noticed myself repeating the same things over and over. </p>

<p>I pulled aside this information and it became this short ebook about how to write emails to potential clients. </p>

<h2>You&#39;re not alone</h2>

<p>Every essay in this book is tested by real freelancers. Every chapter is as short as possible so that you can find what you need, apply it, and move on.</p>

<p>First you must admit the problem: the emails you send to potential clients are probably not great. After all, if you’re currently sending emails in hopes of landing work and not accomplishing that, the results speak for themselves.</p>

<p>If you’re hating life because you have trouble getting clients consistently, fix it by sending better emails.</p>

<p>If you’re currently not sending emails to potential clients but you want to make more money, then the next step is still the same:</p>

<p><a href="">Read this book ($49) and get an upper hand on virtually everyone else.</a>(http://letsworkshop.com)</p>

<h2>What’s in it for you</h2>

<p>A PDF + audio download of the book and life-time access to this website anytime you want to read it. Each chapter on this website also includes bonus material related to the lesson like videos, examples, and more to help you apply the material.</p>

<h2>100% Money-back guarantee</h2>

<p>I don’t want your money if you’re not satisfied. Read the entire book and get your money back if you’re unsatisfied.</p>

<h2>Note: You won’t find scripts in this book</h2>

<p>Although, I love showing examples (and I have whole sections of the book dedicated to breaking them down), scripts almost always encourage writing bad emails. It doesn’t matter how well you disguise it, we can all smell a form email from a mile away. Don’t use them. </p>

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>My name is Robert Williams. I started Workshop, a newsletter that collects the web’s best freelance opportunities and puts them in one place. I&#39;ve helped freelancers find clients and email them for the past year.</p>

<h2>Sending better emails is urgent</h2>

<p>Think about how many emails you send everyday. Think about how many you get. Sending or receiving even 5% more effective emails means thousands of dollars throughout your career. It means hours of your life back. You’re leaving that money and time behind by not reading and sharing this book.</p>

<p><a href="">Tweet it to someone</a>(http://twitter.com/) .@yourfriend hey, have you seen this ebook? it’s about getting freelance work by emailing clients.</p>

<p>PS. This website and book is 100% optimized for those times when you’re desperately seeking work. That means you can easily use it from anywhere - like, say, from your phone on the beach or coffee shop.</p>

<p>You know, the way you thought freelancing would be.</p>
