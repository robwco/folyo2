<h3>These leads have been hand-checked for quality.</h3> 
<p>If you see something you don’t like, let me know. Mistakes happen and errors do get in but I’d hate to see you go back to elance or checking job boards manually because of an error. We want to know about anything you'd like to see removed.
<br><a href="MAILTO:julie@letsworkshop.com?subject=RE: Workshop lead error?&body=Hello Julie! I didn't like seeing this lead: { insert lead } because it { insert reason for disatisfaction } I'd prefer to get something that was more { insert relevant benefit }. Thank you!">Report an error</a></p>

<h3>Unsure about a lead?</h3> 
<p>Remember, contacting just one new opportunity per day comes out to over 20 per month. There's probably no "ideal client" in this email but pick the closest one and send them a quick email. What's the worst that can happen?</p>
