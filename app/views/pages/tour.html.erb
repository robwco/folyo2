	<h1>Do the best work of your life</h1>
	<h2 style="color: #7d8d99; font-weight: 300; margin: 0;">Find clients and freelancers you love working with</h2>

	<p>Folyo is a platform that helps great companies find great freelancers (we were founded in 2011). We worked hard on the newest version of Folyo and we think you’re going to love it. Here’s what we believe.</p>

	<hr>

	<div class="manifesto" id="together">
		<h2>Clients and freelancers are in this together</h2>
	
		<p>They’re natural allies. They want the same thing: to do the  best work of their life. But most sites treat them like enemies. The start of a project isn’t the start of a war. This isn’t a fierce negotiation with a sworn enemy. There’s no need for a budget shakedown, project scope wrestling match, or any of the half a dozen other situations we’ve built up in our minds. The truth is both sides want the same thing: a quick, successful and profitable project. There’s more common ground than you think.</p>
	</div>

	<hr>
	
	<div class="manifesto" id="description">
		<h2>Project outcomes trump skills</h2>
	
		<p>Leave out the skill checkmarks and bullet-lists. They don’t matter. What you can do because of your skill is what matters. Focusing on the outcome of the specific project at hand will give you the best results. Projects aren’t about skills they’re about outcomes.</p>

	<div class="manifesto" id="portfolio">
		<h2>Your portfolio is boring</h2>
	
		<p>Everyone has one. We don’t care. The only thing we care about is if it illustrates how you can help us. Pretty pictures alone don’t tell us that. Instead work needs to be accompanied by your ideas, your reasons, and your results. It’s not about your past projects, it’s about the next one.</p>
	</div>

	<hr>

	<div class="manifesto" id="humans">
		<h2>Humans are required</h2>
	
		<p>It’s rare for a site to require a profile picture to sign up. But that’s exactly why we do. Asking people to use their real photo changes how they use the site. And guess what? It makes them more successful on Folyo. Folyo is about helping people build trust in one another. It’s about making a connection quickly. Allowing a real human being to talk to another without the bull. And a picture of you does more to build that connection than almost anything else.</p>
	</div>
	
	<hr>
	
	<div class="manifesto" id="heart">
		<h2>From the heart</h2>
	
		<p>We want to remove  formalities that malign your projects. That’s why we limit the amount of characters you can use. It means you’re more likely to get to the point and speak about what matters. If there’s a limited amount of space to write, every word counts. Leave the canned, scripted, or auto-generated robot speak at the door.</p>
	</div>

	<hr>
	
	
	<div class="manifesto" id="heart">
		<h2>Oversharing is a disservice to your client</h2>
	
		<p>You don’t need to know someone’s life story to know whether they can help you. Don’t think you have to write an epic novel to win a project. That’s not the case. A short, to-the-point message can be enough. Communication with potential clients isn’t about transferring every bit of knowledge or detail about you, it’s about building trust. Trust can be gained in an instant. That’s your job. Don’t make it about you. Make it about them.</p>
	</div>

	<hr>
	
	
	<div class="manifesto" id="heart">
		<h2>Budgets are poison</h2>
	
		<p>You shouldn’t know how much your project will cost if you haven’t spoken to the person who will work on it yet. Finding that out is part of their job. In fact, it’s one of the most important parts. You’re robbing yourself of value if you do this for them. They have the expertise to guide you.</p>
	</div>

	<hr>
	
	
	<div class="manifesto" id="desperation">
		<h2>Desperation reeks</h2>
	
		<p>You want the right clients and freelancers to come to you. That’s the dream. Yet on most sites you have to chase them around. You have to go searching through projects and portfolios, send emails and PMs, — all without knowing whether they’re even available or interested. Instead focus your efforts. Only go after those looking for someone like you right now. It makes the conversation a lot easier.</p>
	</div>

	<hr>
	
	<div class="manifesto" id="email">
		<h2>Email makes you unprofessional</h2>
	
		<p>Your entire life is in your email. The notes from your mom, your receipts, your spam. That’s why it’s so easy to lose things in there. But the biggest risk is the loss of your time. You waste it by sending unnecessary emails back and forth, searching for lost attachments, and having to go back and re-read old emails for context. It sucks. Professionals value their time. You need to move the conversation out of your inbox sooner.</p>
	</div>

	<hr>
	
	<div class="manifesto" id="job-board">
		<h2>Skip the job board</h2>
	
		<p>Job boards are designed for full-time jobs. They focus exclusively on things that full-time employers care about. There’s the location requirement, the salary range, the benefits, etc. But you have a project. You care more about different things: goals, timeline, scope. These things are forgotten by job boards. Don’t let them be forgotten by you too. </p>
	</div>

	<hr>
	
	<div class="manifesto" id="audience">
		<h2>Your audience is your best pool</h2>
	
		<p>Your audience is you biggest fan. They know you and your brand intimately. They love what you’re doing. They’ve experienced your product or service as an unbiased observer. This is the most valuable group of people ever because they possess insights about where you can improve. Yet, most companies don’t look here when they hire. They go to outside to communities, job boards, or hiring services that ignore their audience. Your project should be open and sharable with the best people, your audience.</p>
	</div>

	<hr>
	
	<div class="manifesto" id="search">
		<h2>Love the search</h2>
	
		<p>For as long as you work you’re going to need to find people you love to work with. It never stops. People leave, new goals arise. That’s why hiring should be enjoyed. You should love the process of finding the right person, or else you won’t love the process of working with them.  The best candidate for you might not be the best for someone else.</p>
