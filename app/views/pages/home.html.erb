<h2>Thousands of businesses are looking for someone like you to build their website, so why surrender to dry spells?</h2>

<p>Because it's not always easy to find them – especially when you're already working too much. Doing lead generation on top of a million other things sucks. Checking job boards every day – or worse: elance – just isn't the best use of your time. You want to do the work you love, not search for it.</p>

<p>That's why too many consultancies wait for work to come to them (read: do nothing at all) – it's just easier. It's why we complain about less-than-ideal clients instead of firing them. It's also why we take on projects that don't pay us what we're worth. Worst of all, it's why we fall into dry spells.</p>

<h2>I too was in the vicious cycle of <strong>feast or famine freelancing</strong>.</h2>

<p>Then I did something about it. I used twitter, job boards, industry websites, anything that could help me find more prospects. I built a daily system for collecting their emails and phone numbers. High-quality prospective clients that I could build my business (and my life) around.</p>

<p>I then contacted each lead with a friendly, personal email and my business took off. In fact my revenue doubled, helping me build a six-figure consultancy, all from leads I found online.</p>

<h1>Imagine what you could accomplish if you weren't worried about finding work.</h1>

<p>Today, if I told you could enjoy the fruits of my labor, instantly skip the years of testing lead generation methods, and just get 10+ highly-qualified leads every morning, what would you do with it?</p>

<p>If overnight you just stopped wasting your time looking for leads and got them sent to you instead. If you could simply reply to people and projects you were excited to work for, straight from your inbox. If it took minutes (instead of hours) to fill your sales pipeline each morning and you focused almost exclusively on billable work – yet still had a constant stream of sales activity.</p>

<p>What then? Would you add that extra feature to your client's project and blow them away? Or would you use the free time to go on a walk and clear your head? Or maybe work on that side-project you've been itching to build?</p>

<p><strong>"How many leads will be sent, and how often?"</strong></p>

<p>I usually send 8-10 leads per day. Sometimes more, <strong>but the whole point of Workshop is that I send fewer, better leads.</strong> I never send a lead just to hit a quota. In fact, Workshop's value is equally about the leads I don't send as it is about the ones I do. The thousands of leads I eliminate from your life completely make the handful I do send more important.</p>

<p><strong>"Do you send my specific type of lead?"</strong></p>

<p>Right now Workshop is mostly focused on web design and development. However, we have a steady amount of other leads coming in like illustration, logo design, and other stuff. The best way to find out if Workshop has what you need is to sign up and see for yourself. I can also send you a sample email if you give me your email address using the form in the lower right corner of this page.</p>

<p><strong>"How long have you been doing this, does it work?"</strong></p>

<p>I started doing this with select consultancies in November, 2013. Since then I've helped hundreds land work. Some have even made hundreds of thousands of dollars from my leads. Now, I focus on Workshop full-time, which wouldn't be possible if it didn't produce massive results for my customers.</p>
