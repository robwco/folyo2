<div class="cancellation-letter">
<h1>Congratulations on landing work!</h1>

<p>How far in advance are you booked? I ask because canceling means you'll lose out on a bunch of money. See, the current pricing for Workshop is about to go up again.</p>

<p>By canceling now it means you’ll be letting your locked-in introductory rate expire.</p>

<p>The subscription you have now comes out to $<%= current_user.subscription.plan.price %>/<%= current_user.subscription.plan.interval %> and soon I wont offer it anymore. I’ll also be limiting the amount of members I let join, so I'd hate to see you not be able to get back in, especially if you fall into a dry spell after you finish work just landed.</p>
 
<p>Currently, you're guaranteed your spot in Workshop at your current low price for as long as you're a member... but not if you cancel.</p>

<p>That’s why this is sort of urgent.</p> 

<p>You might be fully-booked right now, and although it seems like that will last forever–the truth is dry spells happen because freelancers don’t keep looking for opportunities when they have work.</p> 

<p>That’s why I recommend if you’re not booked at least 6-12 months in advanced, you keep emailing at least one new lead every day regardless of if you're currently booked.</p> 

<p>Staying signed up now during this time will also let you negotiate from a position of power instead of being necessity.</p>

<p>In fact, even if cancel Workshop, I’d still recommend you find at least one lead to contact everyday.</p>

<p>Looking forward to having you as a customer!</p>

<p>Regards,<br>
	Robert<br>
