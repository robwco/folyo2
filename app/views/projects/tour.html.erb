			<h1 style="font-size: 26px; margin: 2em 0 0; text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">Find the right fit for your project in under a week without flooding your inbox with garbage.</h1>

			<p>Hiring the right freelancer can feel like finding a needle in a haystack. Your network doesn't know anyone who can help, job boards and marketplaces just plaster your project everywhere and don't attract the quality talent you need.</p>

			<p>They leave you sorting through an inbox full of trash. Reviewing irrelevant resumes and portfolios that don't address your needs -- from low-value freelancers who send the same message to everyone.</p>

			<p>It's not the right first step for a successful project. You're treated as if you're dispensable.</p>

			<p><strong>Yet there's a ticking clock in the background. The longer you take to find someone, the less profitable your project becomes.</strong> Every hour you spend sorting through freelancers is time you could have spent working on your project and making it better.</p>

			<p>But here's the conundrum: rushing the decision could lead to a bad hire. A bad hire is a time-bomb that wrecks your budget, and can even threaten your company's existence.</p>

			<p>Your only option is to do it yourself, or scrap the bottom of the barrel for someone you can afford and hope you just "get it done". But that's not why you started a project in the first place. You started it because you wanted to do something great, not just anything.</p>

	<h1 style="font-size: 26px; margin: 0 0; text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">Your project can attract top-talent that produces massive results NOT mediocre clock-punchers.</h1>

	<p>In fact, a project isn't even what you want done at all. It's not even what you truly care about. You want the results that a project will produce for your business. For example: your project will generate more revenue for your company and keep you in business. THAT'S what you want.</p>

	<p>After all that's what will make your company more valuable. That's what will strengthen your business model. That's what will get you more customers. And allow for a bigger exit when the time comes.</p>
	
	<p>Those results are why you invest so much time doing the scheduling and vetting dance with freelancers.</p>
	
	<p>But without changing this process you'll continue to see mediocre results. Only 1 out of every 3 freelancers you hire will work out. Even less will actually provide measurable results. You'll spend weeks finding a freelancer only to end up not making the wrong choice -- and having to start from scratch weeks later.</p>
	
	<p>But what if you could skip the weeks of sorting  through candidates and invest that time back into getting results from your project?</p>

	<p>What if you could go straight to interviewing great fits for your project so all you have to do is show up and pick from great matches.</p>

	<p>It would mean a direct increase to your bottom line. Because look, your time is valuable. You know you need a problem solved, not just a hired hand. Someone who can create results for your company not just pretty pictures or code.</p>
	
	<p>Getting straight to the best talent available for your project means unleashing creativity on the project that you would have never been able to do if you were stuck reviewing low-quality applicants.</p>

			<h1 style="font-size: 26px; margin: 2em 0 0; text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">We'll help you attract the best freelancer for your project AND your budget, results gauranteed.</h1>
			
			<p>Here's the deal. We'll take care of the stressful and time-wasting parts of hiring a freelancer, you handle choosing the right partner for your project -- and get back to running your business.</p> 
			
			<p>Whether you need a full team or just the occasional freelancer, we'll make it dead simple to find the right fit for your company, project, and budget—or your money back. We’ve chosen to focus on a few things that we believe will start your project on the right foot. Here's how it works:</p>

						<h1 style="font-size: 26px; margin: 1em 0 0; text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">Attract the best candidates on the web and weed out everyone else with our guided project brief.</h1>
						<p>Our short questionnaire you can fill out in minutes, helps you  create a Project Brief strategically designed to attract the best candidates on the web and weed out everyone else.	Next we'll review your brief, and offer personalized suggestions and tips on how to improve it.</p> 
						<p>Since we've worked with clients on all types of projects, we'll give you the inside scoop on what to expect.</p> 
							<p>We don’t mix you in with full-time jobs like most job boards. This just makes it hard to be found. Our entire process is designed for project-based work, not jobs.</p>

			<%= image_tag 'replies.png', :style => "width: 100%; margin: 4em 0 0;" %>

						<h1 style="font-size: 26px; margin: 0; text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">Stay organized and save time by collecting replies outside of your messy inbox.</h1>

						<p>Once the project brief is perfect, you'll immediately start getting replies from the best candidates on the web. We send out your project to a high-value list of 100s of candidates that are the best options available for your budget and specifications.</p>
						<p>Top freelancers and agencies are instantly notified about your project. And we collect replies on our platform so you don’t have to worry about a messy inbox.</p>

						<h1 style="font-size: 26px; margin: 0; text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">Save time picking the perfect candidate.</h1>

						<p>You'll spend less time reviewing applicants because we have a hard word-count on proposals, and require portfolios sent be directly related to your project.</p> 
						<p>This means all replies get to the point quickly and honestly. You want to hire someone to help you solve a problem, not read a bunch of mumbo jumbo.</p>
						<p>You get shown work that is tailored to your project’s goals and show how your partner will be able to help. We even give you our recommendation by hand-reviewing the replies you get so you know who to pick.</p>
						<p>You can setup interviews, chat with applicants, and even pick a partner in minutes. Don’t waste time going through a bunch of portfolios. Every applicant is available, and within your budget.</p>
