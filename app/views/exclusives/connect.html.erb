<p>Eliminate 100% of resume spam by only sending your project to freelancers with skin in the game. There's no job board, no spam, just top freelance design and development shops who have to pay to see your project.</p>
<p>You'll hear back fast (like tomorrow) so fill out the form below and I'll send your project to over 200 world-class consultancies tomorrow morning for free.</p>
<p><strong>Note: This service is 100% free for you.</strong> The only requirement is that your project must be a remote, freelance gig with a budget of at least $1,000 or more. I send out gigs at 8:00 am EST every weekday. You'll hear back fast.</p>
