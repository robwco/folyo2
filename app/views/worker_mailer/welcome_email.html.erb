If you're like I was when i started Workshop you're tired of a few things. You're tired of running out of work. You're tired of having to find clients all by yourself. You're tired of job boards and web apps that get in the way of you and your clients.

That's why I made this thing. It's a newsletter. There's no "app" (at least nothing you can sign into) and you receive leads every day at 8:00 am EST.

It's dead simple, and because of that there are trade offs. I had to settle with not having certain things.

For example, in order to deliver what you paid for right now and not make you wait until tomorrow, I have to link you to a page that can be easily seen by anyone. I've decided to do it anyway because i don't want you to have to wait. All I ask is you don't share this link with anyone.

Here's the link to the latest leads. (http://letsworkshop.com/onboard?utm_source=workshop-member-success-onboard&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=welcome-email-do-not-share-this-link)

You signed up to get this tiny product that i started in my house one day and that's amazing. If you need anything please email me here: robert@letsworkshop.com or reply to this email. I'll usually get back to you at blazing fast speeds.
